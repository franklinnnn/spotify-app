              added to a the deck like a playlist. The deck can then be saved to

              If you have signed in but not seeing anything show up, it maybe
              because you're already signed in on Spotify on the browser. Try
              relogging in, or using a private browser window.

              This app uses purely Spotify's API, so all the data comes from
              Spotify. Unfortunately, Spotify does not provide the actual count
              of how many times a track or an artist was listened to, so we just
              have to trust them on this one.

            <h2 className="text-lg">Why this app?</h2>
            <p>
              At first it was an attempt to see if I could recreate other apps
              that use Spotify's API, like Receiptify. Decided to see what else
              I can access with the Spotify API. I'm not too fond of the way the
              actual Spotify app handles new recommendations, so I'm trying to
              make something that I at least like. Also I wanted access to
              certain song features like tempo, which I use on running
              playlists.
